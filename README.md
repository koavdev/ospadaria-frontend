Welcome to OSPAdaria.

OSPAdaria is a web application developed with Vue.js and integrated with Google Sheets. The motivation behind this project was to assist Dona Lurdes in managing the bakery by optimizing the time spent labeling and controlling the price of each product, while also delivering a pleasant user experience that speeds up the process from product selection to payment.

Payments are made via Pix, with support for both dynamic QR codes and Pix Copia e Cola.

Product management is handled through a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
